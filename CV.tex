September 2012 - May 2013&{\bf Code Club Enrichment Co-Leader}\\[5pt]
&A I became a Stem Ambassador at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester. I helped run a weekly Code Club session with another student. My role was to prepare the sessions and make sure that the files for that session were uploaded so that the children could access them. I then helped run the children overcome their problems when they were doing the worksheets. I gained skills in working in a small team and also verbal communications skills.\\

&Position: Work placement
During my first year of Sixth Form I had to take a two week work experience placement.

% Interests section
\section*{Interests}
\begin{itemize}
\item I have taken a keen interest in photography, this is something I do in spare time. I enjoy going out and taking photos of different scenery. I have a recently created a 500px account which I upload my favourite photographs on and so that I can gain some inspiration from other peoples work. I update my Flickr Photostream regularly whenever I go out to take photographs.
\item Another interest of mine is reading fictional books. This helps me become more creative as a person and with my work especially when designing websites. Also I get a sense of enjoyment reading a series of books where the stories continue and you can see the progression of the different characters.
\item I also recently starting rowing with the rowing club in Borth. Rowing is helping me understand more how to work in a team as everyone in the boat has to work together as a team and timing is very important if you want it to be effective. Rowing has quickly became an interest of mine and is something I enjoy doing this in the afternoon or evening. â€¨
